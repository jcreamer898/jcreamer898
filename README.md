JavaScript and front end technologies are my passion. I also believe that you cannot ever stop learning which is why I stay active in the development community attending user groups like http://nashjs.org, and NashDotNet, blogging on http://jonathancreamer.com, Net Tuts, and Smashing Magazine, tweeting at jcreamer898 and scouring the internet for as much knowledge I can squeeze into my brain.

I work as a Senior Engineer at Eventbrite. I love meeting other devs who are passionate about what they do.
